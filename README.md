# Restaurant Page

Restaurant Page is a browser-based web application created as part of my journey through The Odin Project curriculum. This is my tenth project, and it focuses on building a dynamic and interactive restaurant website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app allows users to navigate through different sections of the restaurant page, such as Home, Menu, and About, with features such as DOM manipulation and Webpack module bundling.

## How to Use

- 🏠 **Home:** Click on the "Home" button to view the home section of the restaurant page.
- 🍽️ **Menu:** Click on the "Menu" button to view the restaurant's menu.
- ℹ️ **About:** Click on the "About" button to learn more about the restaurant.
